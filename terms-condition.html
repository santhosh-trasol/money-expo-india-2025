                <p class="term-text"> Trasol Events reserves the right to cancel or change the date(s) of the Event at
                    any time and for any reason (whether or not due to causes beyond our reasonable control). In the
                    event that the date(s) of the Event are changed to new date(s) that are within twelve (12) months of
                    the originally scheduled opening date of the Event, or where the Event is cancelled but is
                    reasonably expected by Trasol Events to be held at any time in the next calendar year, then, unless
                    we notify you otherwise, your registration will be deemed to be valid for the Event on the new
                    date(s) or when it is next staged (as applicable) in the same way that it would have applied to the
                    originally scheduled Event (and no refund of any paid registration fees will be issued). Where all
                    or part of the Event is cancelled and is not reasonably expected by Trasol Events to be held in the
                    next calendar year, then your registration will no longer be deemed to be valid for the Event (or
                    the cancelled portion of the Event, as applicable) and, at your election, any paid registration fees
                    for the Event (or the cancelled portion of the Event, as applicable) will be refunded or a credit
                    note issued for the same, and you will be released from paying any further amount of registration
                    fees for the Event (or the cancelled portion of the Event, as applicable). Service charges are
                    non-refundable. Personal arrangements, including, without limitation, travel and accommodation, are
                    at your own risk and Trasol Events will not be liable for any costs relating to such arrangements,
                    even if the Event is cancelled or moved to new date(s). You acknowledge and agree that the
                    provisions of this paragraph set out your sole remedy in the event of cancellation or the changing
                    of the date(s) of the Event and all other liability of Trasol Events is hereby expressly excluded.
                    Refund of printed registration price if admission is refused. Discounts cannot be combined or
                    applied to previous registration</p>
